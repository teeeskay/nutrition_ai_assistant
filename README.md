This is a modular, agent-based nutrition and meal planner app built using LangGraph, open-source LLMs (e.g.,LLaMa, Mistral), and food and nutrition datasets (e.g. EFSA). It guides users through understanding their nutritional needs, refining their diet, selecting recipes, and generating grocery lists â€” all through a natural, conversational interface with user-in-the-loop control.
